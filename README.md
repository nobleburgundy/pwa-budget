## Description

Need to track your budget while on the go - with potentially interrupted internet connections? Offline Budget is for you. A simple Progressive Web Application that will track your deposits and expenses whether you're online or off. When you come back online, you're data is updated.

## Installation

There should be an icon in the address bar of your browser to install the application for offline use. If using Chrome, it should look like this...

## Usage

You can enter your deposits and expenses. This works whether or not you have an internet connection, then is updated when the connection is back. _Note_: you may have to refresh the browser once or twice once you have a connection again to see transactions that were entered offline.
